# Other utility functions...


# This function sets up a temporary test database by creating a temporary directory and returning the path to the database file within that directory. 

# You can customize this function to perform additional setup steps specific to your database setup, such as running migrations or initializing the schema.

# This function is used to clean up temporary directories created during testing. It takes the path to the directory as input and removes it, along with all its contents, using shutil.rmtree().

# You can include additional utility functions in utils.py as needed for your testing purposes. These functions should help streamline your testing workflow and make it easier to write and maintain your tests.
